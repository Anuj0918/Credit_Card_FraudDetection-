# Credit_Card_FraudDetection-
A simple project to understand different classification models.
I have used the famous problem of Credit Card Fraud Detection in Data Science domain to take a brief look at 3 things:

1.Handling Imbalanced data
2.The practical differences in 2 classification models.

In the main file named "credit-card-fraud.ipynb" I have given description of all the steps I have done and in the end explained the difference in the 2 models I selected for comparison.
The 2 models I selected were the very famous: Decision Tree, Random Forest  Classifiers from sklearn library.

The original data file was larger than the limit Github offers, so I have used a sample file to showcase the data. You can download the original dataset from [Here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
